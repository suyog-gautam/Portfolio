Please apply the following final visual and functional enhancements to the portfolio site:
🔹 Summary Section (Hero)

    Profile Image Hover Effect:

        Add a hover animation to the profile image in the summary (hero) section.

            Example: Soft zoom-in effect or a gentle glow on hover.

            Keep it smooth and elegant.

🔹 About Me Section

    ✅ No changes needed — leave this section as-is.

🔹 Technical Proficiencies (Skills) Section

    Keep the content and layout as it is, but:

        Change the card background to match the About Me section’s background.

        Avoid full transparency — currently, the transparent background makes 3D objects distracting.

        The card should feel grounded and visually tied to the rest of the design.

🔹 Background Consistency (Across Other Sections)

    For the following sections, change the card/background style to match the About Me section's card background (e.g., semi-transparent dark with blur, or soft glowing container):

        Soft Skills

        Education Cards

        Projects

        Contact Cards

        ⚠️ Important: Ensure consistent styling across these sections. The background should reduce distraction from any 3D object used behind it.

🔹 Scroll & Page Load Effects (Three.js Enhancements)

    Add subtle 3D scroll-based animations using Three.js:

        E.g., glowing orbs, floating lines, or soft geometric shapes moving in the background as the user scrolls through sections.

        Keep it subtle and non-distracting — it should complement the site, not overpower it.

    Page Load Animation:

        On full refresh or first-time visit, add a custom loading animation.

            For example: Animate a 3D object or "Suyog Gautam" name fade-in, or particles assembling into your name.

        It should be quick, elegant, and match the dark theme aesthetic.

🔹 Final Polish

    Ensure the following across the site:

        Poppins font is applied site-wide.

        All layout spacing remains clean and consistent.

        Smooth transitions on all hover states.

        Theme toggle still works properly with these changes.

        Responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
