Build a modern, responsive, and aesthetic personal portfolio website for Suyog Gautam. The design should be dark-themed with a midnight blue gradient background. Use Three.js creatively to enhance the experience, but keep it light and elegant — no heavy scenes.
🎨 Design Guidelines:

    Dark tone with midnight blue gradients, soft shadows, and glowing accents (e.g., neon borders or text highlights).

    Use Three.js in these areas:

        Background animations (e.g., slow floating particles, gradient plane)

        Hover effects on project cards (e.g., 3D tilt, depth glow)

        Scroll-based animations (e.g., reveal components with fade/scale)

    Use CSS or GSAP for smooth transitions and Three.js for subtle 3D movement.
