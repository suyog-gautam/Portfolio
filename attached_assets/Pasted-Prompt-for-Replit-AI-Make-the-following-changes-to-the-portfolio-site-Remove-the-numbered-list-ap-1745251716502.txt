Make the following changes to the portfolio site: Remove the numbered list approach.for the setion and use different appoarch
1. Navigation Bar (Navbar):

    Remove the left-side section containing the sign (it’s unnecessary).

    Center the navigation links with "Home" added to the list of links.

    Hover Glow Effect: When hovering over or selecting a navigation link, add a glow effect to indicate the active page. For example, when the "Projects" section is being viewed, the "Projects" link should glow.

    Remove the "Resume" link from the navbar, as the resume download option is already in the Contact Section.

2. Homepage Section:

    Change "Contact" to "Connect" in the navbar and apply a hover glow effect to it.

    In the Home section, create a "Connect" button that redirects to the Contact Section. Apply a glowing hover effect to this button.

    Organize the layout aesthetically—instead of a vertical up-and-down design, make the content flow horizontally or in grid-like sections for a modern look. Use different spacing and alignment to keep it visually organized.

3. Technical Proficiencies Section:



    Each technology box should have a glowing effect when hovered over.

    Add a subtle overall glow effect to the entire section to make it stand out and look interactive.

4. Projects & Education Cards:

    Different Background Colors: Apply different background colors to project cards, education cards, and skills cards to create contrast.

    Projects Section Hover Effect:

        On hover, the project card should rotate 180° to reveal the description of the project behind it.

        Before hovering, display the project image on the front of the card.

        Project cards should be laid out in an aesthetically organized way (e.g., grid, row, or card layout) to avoid a cluttered look.

5. Contact Section:

    Remove the form from the Contact section.

    Keep the resume download option in the Contact Section.

    Make sure the section is neatly aligned, with the "Connect" button clearly visible and the resume download option organized as well.

6. Dark Mode / Light Mode:

    Add a dark/light mode toggle switch as a circular button at the bottom left corner of the site.

    The default mode should be dark.

    When toggling to light mode, the background should switch to a light color scheme with suitable text colors for visibility and contrast.

    Ensure smooth transitions between dark and light modes to make the experience seamless.

7. Three.js Enhancements:

    Add Three.js elements that visually reflect the dark/light mode theme.

    Implement subtle 3D animations or interactive elements that respond to scrolling or hovering.

    Use Three.js to enhance the site’s background or sections to make it feel more dynamic without overwhelming the user.

8. Font:

    Apply the Poppins font throughout the site for a modern and clean look.

    Ensure that headings and text are styled to be easily readable, with proper hierarchy and spacing.

9. Additional Style Requests:

    Use smooth animations and transitions for hover effects such as scaling, glowing, and rotating.

    Ensure the site is responsive for both mobile and desktop views.

    Organize content in a clean, grid-based layout instead of stacking sections vertically. This will make the site feel more polished and aesthetic while maintaining a fluid and modern design.
