Make the following changes to the portfolio site:

    Navigation Bar (Navbar):

        Remove the left-side section that contains the sign (this is unnecessary).

        Center the navigation links, with "Home" added to the list of links.

        When hovering over or selecting a navigation link, add a glow effect to indicate the active page. For example, if the "Projects" section is being viewed, the "Projects" link in the navbar should glow.

        Remove the "Resume" link from the navbar, as the resume download option is already in the Contact Section.

        Change "Contact" to "Connect" in the navbar, and apply a hover glow effect to it.

    Homepage Section:

        In the Home section, display my profile picture alongside my name and summary.

    Technical Proficiencies Section:

        Remove the numbered list approach for the Technical Proficiencies section.

        Instead of numbering, use boxes for each technology (e.g., Python, React), and apply a glowing effect on each box.

        Use a subtle overall glow effect for this section to make it stand out.

    Projects & Education Cards:

        Apply a different background color for the project cards, education cards, and skills cards to give them contrast.

        For the projects section:

            On hover, the project card should rotate 180Â° to reveal the description of the project behind it.

            Before hovering, display the project image on the front of the card.

    Contact Section:

        Remove the form from the Contact section, as it is no longer needed.

        Leave the resume download option there, as previously mentioned.

    Dark Mode / Light Mode:

        Add a dark/light mode toggle switch in a circle at the bottom left corner of the site.

        The default mode should be dark, but when toggling, the background should switch to light mode with suitable colors for the text and backgrounds in the light mode.

    Three.js Enhancements:

        Add more Three.js elements that reflect the dark/light mode theme.

        Include some subtle 3D animations or interactive elements as the user scrolls or hovers.

    Font:

        Apply the Poppins font throughout the site.

Additional Style Requests:

    Use smooth animations and transitions for hover effects, such as scaling, glowing, and rotating.

    Ensure the website remains responsive and optimized for mobile and desktop screens.
