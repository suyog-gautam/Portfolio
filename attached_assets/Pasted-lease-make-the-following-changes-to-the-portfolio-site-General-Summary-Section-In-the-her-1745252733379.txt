lease make the following changes to the portfolio site:
🔹 General & Summary Section

    In the hero/summary section, only display "Suyog Gautam" as the name/title — do not include "Computer Systems Engineer" here.

    There should be two buttons side by side:

        "View My Work"

        "Connect"

    Both buttons should have the same hover glow effect, consistent styling, and smooth animations.

🔹 Section Numbering & Layout

    Remove the numbering from all sections (like 01, 02, etc.).

    Instead of numbering, apply a subtle Three.js animation or 3D style background effect behind each section title (like “About Me”, “Technical Proficiencies”, etc.) for modern aesthetics.

    Maintain side-by-side layout between:

        About Me and Technical Proficiencies — even after removing the “Connect With Me” portion from About Me.

        Make sure both sections are visually aligned and balanced.

🔹 Technical Proficiencies Section

    Keep the technology boxes (e.g., Python, JavaScript).

    Each tech box should have a hover glow effect.

    Apply a subtle overall glow to the entire section background for aesthetics.

    Ensure it’s visually aligned with About Me (as mentioned above).

🔹 Education Section

    Both education cards should use the same design and style.

    On hover, the cards should match each other in animation and style (e.g., glow effect or shadow pop).

🔹 Projects Section

    Revert the project cards to the previous design (remove the 180° flip/rotate on hover).

    Bring back the original layout and hover behavior for projects that you were using earlier.

🔹 Contact Section

    Keep the "Contact" section title.

    In the Contact cards (email, GitHub, etc.):

        On click, each card should redirect appropriately:

            Clicking the email card should open a mailto: link.

            Clicking the GitHub card should open your GitHub profile.

    Remove the form (if not already removed).

    Keep the resume download option.

🔹 Theme: Dark/Light Mode

    Maintain the current dark theme design as default.

    For the light mode, use a different set of colors that:

        Contrast well with the text (no washed-out or super bright backgrounds).

        Maintain readability and visual hierarchy.

        Adjust button styles and card backgrounds accordingly.

    Ensure smooth transition between dark and light modes.

🔹 Font

    Use the Poppins font consistently across all sections and elements.

🔹 Interactivity & Aesthetics

    Keep hover glow effects for buttons and links across all sections.

    Make sure all sections have a consistent layout (grid or side-by-side, not stacked unless needed).

    Ensure a responsive design for both desktop and mobile views.

    Use Three.js sparingly but tastefully for:

        Section headings or subtle background interaction.

        Scroll or hover-based visual feedback.

    Keep animations smooth and professional, not overwhelming.
